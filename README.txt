Project overview:
  Very basic mouse jiggler script programmed in Python. This repository includes two versions of the script: jiggler.py, which by default moves the mouse every 10 seconds very slightly before moving back, and
  jiggler_rand.py, which randomizes the mouses movement and time between movements, while still returning the mouse to where it was before the jiggler. Both of these scripts will run indefinitely after being invoked
  and can be stopped at any time by either issuing a keyboard interrupt or killing the process. 

Instructions:
  1. If it is not already installed, use pip to install the pyautogui library
  2. Run the desired script
  3. When you wish to stop the mouse jiggler, simply kill the process or issue a keyboard interrupt (CTRL+C on Windows)
